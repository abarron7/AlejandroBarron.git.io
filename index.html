                I am a student who works fulltime and also goes to school at night. I enjoy technology and cool
                gadgets. My
                hobbies are video games, movies, television shows, comic book superheroes, and solving puzzles.
                I have found a great interest in programming and web design. I started off learning how to code when I
                taught myself how to code in Python. That doesn't mean I have mastered it... yet. I have always enjoyed
                meeting new people
                and
                also
                working with others. My goal is to someday build a career and start a family whom I can care for and
                love.
                Mostly I want to lead a simple, yet exciting and fun life! </p>
