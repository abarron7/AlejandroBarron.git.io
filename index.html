        <p>
          I am a student who works fulltime and also goes to school at night. I enjoy technology and cool
          gadgets. My
          hobbies are video games, movies, television shows, comic book superheroes, and solving puzzles.
          I have found a great interest in programming and web design. I started off learning how to code when I
          taught myself how to code in Python. That doesn't mean I have mastered it... yet. I have always enjoyed
          meeting new people
          and
          also
          working with others. My goal is to someday build a career and start a family whom I can care for and
          love.
          Mostly I want to lead a simple, yet exciting and fun life!
